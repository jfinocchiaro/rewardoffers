# reward offers


TODO:
   X - remove reward offers from genome, add as parameter to makeDecision
   X - change genome to bits (or change conditions on accepting an offer)
   X - change mutation to bit flip
   make sure customer can only trade in per flight 

LATER:
    custom mutation function (add 1, 2, or 3 mod 4)
    generate urgency of trip / genome back to 1-4


generation:
  x flights (try different numbers)
    progression of rewards until all accepted or rewards maxed
